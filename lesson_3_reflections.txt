When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- Collaborating with others. Using githubs nice UI =)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Avoid auto pulls of changes others made

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- forks are copies of repositories on github
- cloing is copying a repository from cloud to local or local to local
- branches are labels for commits within a repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- for working offline and reviewing any conflicts before merging them
